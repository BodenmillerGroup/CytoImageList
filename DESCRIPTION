Version: 0.1.2
Title: S4 class for storing single- or multi-channel images
Description: 
    Highly multiplexed imaging measures the abundance of biomolecules in tissues
    and generates multi-channel (>4) images encoding abundance levels as pixel
    intensities. Most commonly, color images are stored as 3-channel RGB or
    4-channel RGBA images. In contrast, the `CytoImageList` S4 class stores 
    multi-channel images in the format xyc where x and y are the physical 
    dimensions of the images and c the number of channels. Each channel is 
    stored as grayscale array. The package further provides getter and setter 
    functions for assessing images and channels and functionality for
    merging channels.
